## Question

Given two strings A and B, return whether or not A can be shifted some number of times to get B.

For example, if A is `abcde` and B is `cdeab`, return `true`. If A is `abc` and B is `acb`, return `false`.

## Proposed Solution

Pre-test for the strings being different lengths, then just shift and compare.
    
## Testing

Running the program will show the return values for the two examples in the question.

## Question
Invert a binary tree.

For example, given the following tree:

        a
       / \
      b   c
     / \  /
    d   e f
    
should become:

      a
     / \
    c   b
     \ / \
     f e  d
     
## Proposed Solution
...no idea how this was a "Medium" difficulty problem, just recursively change the left and right nodes around.

## Testing
running the program will print the top tree, inverse it, and print the result, which should be the bottom tree.

## Question
Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse it in-place.

## Proposed Solution
Grab by threes, make the second point to the first, then take the second, third, and the following object if not None.
    
## Testing
Running the code first asks for a list length and creates a list with values equivalent to the node's position; then it displays the list in its normal order, reverses it, and displays the resulting list.
